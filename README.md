### 1. What does this plugin do?
This Plugin aids with syncing data between Unity and Gridly.
This includes the uploading of screenshots generated from Unity.
By using the path, you can obtain string data based on the
target language.

### 2. Setup first columns in Gridly
To be able to use this plugin, there are some
initial steps you will have to complete within Gridly so that the
plugin can refer to the correct columns. First you
need to specify a **columnID**. You have to initially do this for the source language column. 
Open the relevant Grid in Gridly and in the source language column header, select the option **Column properties**.

</p>

Change the columnID to the specific four
character language code that applies to the text in the column,
make sure that the capitalization is correctly entered. The two
country letters should be capitalized:

</p>

### 3. Connect Unity to Gridly
### 3.1 Plugin install steps
- Download the code from GitHub
- Unzip the package
- Copy the Gridly folder into your project assets folder

### 3.2 Setup in Unity
First you need to open the Gridly settings window by going to:
**Tools**->**Gridly**->**Setup Setting**  
<p align="center">
<img src="resources/setup_setting.png"/>
</p>

Here you have to enter your API key and define the folder in which to store the screenshots that are generated.   
<p align="center">
<img src="resources/setup_setting_mw.png"/>
</p>

You can find your API key in Gridly in the API quick start menu in the right pane:

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/api_quick_start.png"/>
</p>

By default the plugin adds two views, but those are dummies, so feel free to delete or change their name and viewID.  
You can add a new view by clicking on the plus icon
<p align="center">
<img src="resources/add_new_view.png"/>
</p>

### 3.3 Maintain languages in the plugin
* You can add a language by selecting a language from the list and clicking on the "Add" button. Adding a language to your project will then create a column for this language in Gridly
<p align="center">
<img src="resources/lang_selectLang.png"/>
</p>

* You can remove the language by clicking on the "X" button. On deleting a language, you will see two dialogs. The first will ask you whether you want to remove the language from Unity, and the second will ask you about deleting the language and the screenshot column related to this language in Gridly.

</p>

* You can select what type of font you would like to use by setting the "Font" or the "TmFont". TmFont is the Text Mesh Pro font.
* You can select the column for storing images of the given language by clicking on the dropdown menu next to the "Screenshot column ID". If you don't have any, you can create one by clicking on the "Generate column" button, which creates a "files" type column in Gridly. Then select this column ID from the list.
